# Network Observatory

Turn your LinkedIn export into a private map of your professional network — a
star field of every person you're connected to, that you can pan, search, and
filter — and then into a small personal CRM your AI agent can actually reason
over. It runs on your own machine. Optional Gmail enrichment uses a separate
metadata-only connection that you explicitly approve.

The idea: your network is a kind of memory, and right now it's locked in a CSV.
This gives your agent a database it can reason over, and gives you a way to
actually see who you know.

### Three screens, one memory

| | |
|---|---|
| **Map** | Who you know. Every connection as a star, clustered by company, role, seniority, or era. |
| **Warmth** | How alive each relationship is, with the receipts. "No data" is never dressed up as "cold". |
| **People** | The working list: prioritize someone, snooze them to a date, or confirm that an email contact is a LinkedIn person you already know. |

They share one design and link to each other, so it's one link to open, not
three. The map alone works with nothing but your LinkedIn export; the other two
fill in as you connect optional sources.

Your agent drives all of it in plain language — *"who have I gone cold on?"*,
*"remind me about Ada in six months"*, *"who did I meet last week?"* — and the
screens are where you see the answers.

## Give this to your agent as one link

Send your agent this URL and it can set up the core Observatory from scratch:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maczumby/network-observatory/main/skills/network-observatory/SKILL.md
```

The LinkedIn map needs nothing from anyone: your export in, your map out, all
on your machine. On your own computer, you can also add Gmail metadata locally
with `scripts/email_recency.py`.

New Gmail setup for hosted agents is temporarily paused while the exact-agent
flow is finished. The old Connect page and manual setup command are retired.
An already-working legacy metadata connection may still be used, but it must
not be re-created through the old flow.

## The fastest way to use it

Give this whole folder to your coding agent (Claude Code or similar), then send
one message with your LinkedIn export attached or dropped in:

> Here's my LinkedIn export. Set this up and show me my network.

The agent reads `CLAUDE.md` and walks you through it in order, one step at a time,
checking in with you before moving on:

1. **Build your map** from your export.
2. **Get you a link** to open it (a file on your own machine, or a public link if
   you're on a hosted agent like Agent37).
3. **Offer a password**, since that link is public by default.
4. **Optionally let people ask your agent about your network** in shared channels.

You don't run anything yourself. Each step waits for you, so you're never more
than one "yes" ahead of what's happening.

## Give the public repo to Hermes

Send your agent this link:

<https://github.com/maczumby/network-observatory>

Hermes can clone it, read `CLAUDE.md`, and build the LinkedIn map without any
Google or Composio account. To install the reusable Hermes skill directly:

```bash
hermes skills install \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maczumby/network-observatory/main/skills/network-observatory/SKILL.md \
  --yes
```

The public repo does not contain baked-in authentication. New Gmail setup for
hosted agents is temporarily unavailable, apart from the operator-controlled Day
test harness. Do not use the retired Connect page, paste a private manual setup
command, substitute a default Composio or Gmail connection, or follow a provider
reconnect link.

If this agent already has a working `network-observatory-gmail` connection, it
may keep using its metadata-only tools. If it is missing or disconnected, stop
there. Once the exact agent has a **Connections > Gmail** control in AgentMarkit,
that control will be the setup path. Do not send someone there unless the
control is actually present on their agent.

## Or run it yourself

Two commands, no installation (Python 3 and a browser are all you need):

```bash
# 1. put your LinkedIn export (.zip, folder, or Connections.csv) in exports/
python3 scripts/linkedin_import.py

# 2. build and open the map
python3 scripts/observatory_export.py --open
```

Step 1 creates `data/linkedin.db`. Step 2 creates `dashboard/observatory.html`, a
single file you can open any time or send to yourself.

Once there's contact signal in the database (see Trellis below), build the other
two screens the same way:

```bash
python3 scripts/warmth_export.py       # dashboard/warmth.html
python3 scripts/reconcile.py           # look for identity matches
python3 scripts/workbench_export.py    # dashboard/workbench.html  (People)
```

The People screen reads the proposals `reconcile.py` writes, so run it first
if you want the "same person as…?" suggestions.

Each page is self-contained: fonts embedded, no external requests, works
offline. Opened as files they're read-only, and anything you mark gives you a
block of text to paste back to your agent. To make the controls write directly,
serve them with the write API on:

```bash
python3 scripts/serve.py --set-password "something long"
python3 scripts/serve.py --rw --rw-local-only
```

`--rw` needs a saved password, and `--rw-local-only` means people you share the
viewing link with can look but not change anything.

**Running through a hosted agent** (like Agent37/Hermes) instead of on your own
machine? The agent can't open a browser on your screen, so instead of `--open` it
serves the map (`scripts/serve.py`) and exposes it on a public link it verifies
works before sending — you get a clickable "Open Network Observatory" link, not a
file to wrangle. That link is public until you add a password (the agent offers
one). The lock is a real login page: paste works, password managers work, no
browser popup, and once set it survives server restarts. The password is stored
only as a salted hash on the machine serving the map; nothing secret appears in
the page source. If you'd rather not expose a link at all, it can still just
hand you the self-contained `observatory.html` file to open locally.

Why not "Sign in with Google"? Google requires the exact login-return URL to be
registered ahead of time, and hosted-agent public URLs rotate per instance, so
a Google button would break every time the link changes. If these pages ever
get a stable domain, the operator's existing Google Cloud project can supply
the OAuth client and this becomes worth revisiting.

## Getting your LinkedIn export

LinkedIn → **Settings → Data Privacy → Get a copy of your data**. Choose the
"Basic" archive that includes Connections; it usually arrives by email within a
few minutes. Drop the `.zip` into the `exports/` folder here.

## What you get

- **A local database** (`data/linkedin.db`) of every connection: name, company,
  title, when you connected, plus a function and seniority level read from each
  job title.
- **A visual explorer** with three ways to see the same people: Groups (clusters
  that share an attribute, with constellation lines on hover), Timeline (you at the
  center, time as distance), or Ranked columns.
  Color by company, role, seniority, or era. Search anyone, filter and combine,
  and click a star to read details, jot a private note, or flag someone to
  reconnect with.
- **A short reading** of your network: how many people over how many years, where
  your center of gravity sits, and who's worth reconnecting with.

## Will this work for my network?

Yes, with one caveat worth knowing up front.

- **Any size.** Tested from a handful of connections up to 12,000. Large networks
  (past ~15,000) still render but the animation gets heavier on older machines.
- **Any language.** LinkedIn localizes the export — French headers, German dates,
  and so on. The importer reads by column position rather than English text, so
  your names, companies, titles, and dates come through whatever language your
  export is in. The map, search, and the company and era views all work.
- **Any industry.** Roles are sorted into buckets that cover tech, healthcare,
  law, education, finance, trades, government, nonprofit, science, hospitality,
  the arts, and more. Anything that doesn't map cleanly goes to "Other."

**The caveat:** the role and seniority guess reads *English* job titles. If your
export is in another language, most people will land in "Other" and "Individual
contributor" for the role and seniority views, because the tool doesn't yet
recognize titles like "Directeur des ventes." Everything else still works. If you
want your language supported, it's a small change to the keyword lists in
`scripts/linkedin_import.py` — ask your agent to add it.

## Trellis — remembering, not just seeing

The map shows your network; **Trellis** helps you tend it. It's a local relationship
memory on the same data: ask "who is X, when did we last talk, what do I owe them,"
log what happened when you meet someone, and get a short, reasoned list of who's worth
reaching out to. Every answer cites where it came from, it drafts only from real facts
(never invents), and it never sends anything.

```bash
python3 scripts/trellis.py recall "Maya"     # who is she, our history, open loops
python3 scripts/trellis.py loops             # who you left hanging
python3 scripts/trellis.py radar             # a few reach-outs worth making, with reasons
python3 scripts/trellis.py warmth            # who's warm, who's going cold, what's unmeasured
```

Once email or calendar events flow in, `python3 scripts/warmth_export.py` bakes
a browsable table (`dashboard/warmth.html`, same password as the map): every
contact's last-contact date, who wrote last, a temperature label, and the
receipts behind each row. It leads with coverage — how much of your graph is
actually measured — and shows unmeasured people as "no data", never "cold".

### Marking people, and coming back to them

Two separate things, because they answer different questions — how much someone
matters, and when to look again:

```bash
python3 scripts/trellis.py capture --name "Ada" --prioritize
python3 scripts/trellis.py capture --name "Ada" --deprioritize
python3 scripts/trellis.py capture --name "Ada" --follow-up "in 6 months" \
    --follow-up-reason "after their launch"
```

A due follow-up surfaces in `radar` **even if you deprioritized the person** —
"not now, but check back in six months" is the whole point. Both are reversible,
and you can do all of it by asking your agent in plain language, or from the
People screen.

### Keeping it honest

Sweeps mint contacts from addresses, and addresses lie. Two commands keep the
graph clean, and neither one decides anything for you:

```bash
python3 scripts/reconcile.py           # regenerate the review queues; changes nothing
python3 scripts/reconcile.py --apply   # mute your own addresses + obvious non-people
```

The first writes two review files under `data/`: email contacts that look like
LinkedIn people you already know, and addresses that may not be people at all.
Merging identities is always your call and always reversible. Tell it who you
are first — put your addresses (and your team's domain) in
`data/owner_identities.json`, or your own inbox becomes part of your network.

The reasoning behind all of this is in [`docs/DATA_INTEGRITY.md`](docs/DATA_INTEGRITY.md).

It works from your LinkedIn graph and what you tell it, and gets richer if your agent
feeds it meetings, email, or calendar. Trellis stores no connector tokens and keeps its
memory local. When you flag
or note people in the map, the "Sync to your agent" button hands them back to Trellis.
Identity duplicates are never merged automatically. Confirmed merges are journaled and
can be undone with `trellis.py unmerge`, including their history and relationship metadata.
See `skills/trellis.md`.

## A note on what's inferred

Your export gives a name, company, title, and connection date. Function
(Engineering, Sales, Founder, and so on) and seniority (Entry through Executive)
are read from the job title with fixed rules. These are labeled *inferred*
everywhere they appear. Titles that don't map cleanly are grouped as "Other"
rather than forced into a category.

## Privacy

Your export, the database, and the generated page contain personal contact data,
so the tool keeps all of it local. `.gitignore` excludes `exports/`, `data/`, and
`dashboard/` output, so you won't accidentally commit any of it. The generated HTML
is fully self-contained — fonts and everything else are embedded, so it makes no
network calls at all and works with the internet off. Your data never leaves your
machine.

Optional hosted Gmail enrichment is a separate, explicit boundary. When the new
exact-agent flow is available, Google OAuth tokens stay in Composio and the
service passes only allowlisted message metadata to that agent. It never
receives the LinkedIn export or Trellis database. See `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`.

## Keeping it current

The tool improves over time. To get the latest, just tell your agent **"update the
network-observatory tool."** It fetches the newest version, copies it over the code, and
rebuilds your map — **your data, flags, and notes are never touched** (they live in
`data/`, which updates leave alone). The `VERSION` file shows what you have.

Under the hood that's `python3 scripts/update.py` (or `--from-zip PATH` if someone sent
you a new zip instead of a link).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer (standard library only — nothing to `pip install`)
- A web browser to view the map

## Changing it

Everything here is meant to be read and modified. `CLAUDE.md` explains how the
pieces fit together; `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY.md` is the contract to read before
touching anything about people, identity, or status.

There's a test suite, and it's the fastest way to know you haven't broken
someone else's database:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Standard library, no test runner to install, no CI — so run it yourself before
you ship a change.

## License

The code is released under the MIT License. That gives people and their agents
clear permission to use, copy, modify, and redistribute the project, including
commercially, as long as they keep the copyright and license notice. It also
states that the software is provided without warranty. The license grants code
rights; it does not grant access to the operator's Composio key, Google project,
or anyone else's data.

## How this was made

The visual started as a design built in [Claude](https://claude.ai) and was ported
into this self-contained page. The import and export scripts were built with an AI
agent too. It's meant to be read and changed; see `CLAUDE.md` for how the pieces
fit together.
