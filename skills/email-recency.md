# Email recency — when did I last talk to this person?

Asks Gmail how long it's been since you exchanged email with someone: last
contact date, who wrote last, and a temperature label (active, warm, cooling,
cold). Feed it one contact, a list, or every LinkedIn connection in your
network database that shared an email address.

This is the one piece of network-observatory that holds a credential, so the
deal is spelled out here. Trellis and the map never touch the network; this
script talks to Google directly, using the most limited Gmail access that
exists (`gmail.metadata`). Under that permission Google's own servers return
message headers only — From, To, Cc, Date — and refuse to return bodies or
attachments no matter what the software asks for. The restriction is
enforced by Google, not promised by this code. Your token stays in
`data/gmail_token.json` on your machine and you can kill it any time at
myaccount.google.com/permissions.

## What you can do

```bash
# one person
python3 scripts/email_recency.py "sam@example.com"

# a list, one contact per line
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --batch contacts.txt

# every LinkedIn connection that shared an email with you
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --from-db

# machine-readable, deeper sweep
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --from-db --json --limit 2000
```

First run opens a browser consent screen; approve it once and you're set.
It needs an OAuth client JSON at `data/gmail_oauth_client.json` (ask Mari
for the Filament Email Recency client, or the script prints instructions
for making your own).

## For the agent

- Prefer `--json`. Check the `sweep` block first: nonzero `failed` or
  `undated` means the sweep was incomplete, and an incomplete sweep can only
  understate contact. Say so instead of reporting staleness as fact.
- "Nothing found" means "not in the last N messages swept" (default 500),
  not "never emailed". Raise `--limit` before concluding there's no history.
- A name fragment matches as a substring, so it can hit the wrong person.
  Every result carries `matched_address`; name it in your answer so the user
  can catch a mismatch you can't.
- Results sort stalest first. Lead with the people past 60 days; that's the
  actionable end.
- `--subjects` is the one flag that pulls message content (subject lines).
  Leave it off unless the user explicitly asks what the threads were about.
- Recency labels: active is 14 days or fewer, warm is 15 to 60, cooling is
  61 to 180, cold is over 180.
- Pairs well with Trellis: a `--from-db --json` run is exactly the shape to
  feed `trellis capture` interactions, so radar and loops can reason over
  real email recency. Do that only when the user asks for it.

## On hosted agents (Hermes): use an existing connection only

`email_recency.py` is still for agents running on the user's own computer. If
you are a hosted agent (Hermes, Agent37), do not set up local OAuth and do not
ask the user for a client JSON, Google secret, or Composio key.

New hosted Gmail setup is temporarily unavailable, apart from the
operator-controlled Day test harness. If this exact agent already has a working
`network-observatory-gmail` connection, it may keep using it. If not, stop. Do
not use the retired Connect page, ask for a private manual setup command, open a
default Composio or Gmail connection, or send a provider reconnect link. Do not
re-provision a disconnected legacy connection.

Future setup starts from the exact agent in AgentMarkit, then **Connections >
Gmail**, only when that control exists. For an existing working connection:

1. Call `network_observatory_sweep_email_metadata`, 25 messages at a time.
   Follow `nextPageToken` only as far as the user's question needs. Gmail's
   metadata scope does not allow `q`, so match identities locally.
2. Normalize each message into a Trellis event and hand it over:

```bash
python3 scripts/trellis.py ingest --json '[
  {"person": {"name": "Sam Rivera", "email": "sam@example.com"},
   "kind": "email",
   "date": "2026-07-22",
   "summary": "email received",
   "source": "gmail",
   "source_ref": "<gmail message id>"}
]'
```

Use `<gmail-message-id>:<correspondent-email>` as `source_ref` when a message
contains multiple external participants. That makes ingest idempotent, so re-running over the same messages
is safe: already-seen events are skipped. After ingest, `trellis.py recall`,
`loops`, and `radar` answer recency questions from the same data the local
script would have produced. Store who and when, not what was said.

The hosted tools cannot return subject, snippet, body, or attachments. If a
call returns `reconnectUrl`, do not send or follow it. Treat the connection as
unavailable and tell the user hosted Gmail setup is paused.

## Design credit

The metadata-only approach follows Maria's email-recency skill
(github.com/123maria0608-star/email-recency-skill). This is an independent
implementation, written for this repo's zero-dependency rule: Python
stdlib only, raw Gmail REST, no Google client libraries.
