# Email recency — when did I last talk to this person?

Asks Gmail how long it's been since you exchanged email with someone: last
contact date, who wrote last, and a temperature label (active, warm, cooling,
cold). Feed it one contact, a list, or every LinkedIn connection in your
network database that shared an email address.

## Choose the right Gmail path first

- **Hosted agent (Hermes or Agent37):** do not run the local OAuth script and
  do not ask for a client JSON, Google secret, or Composio key. Use this exact
  agent's `network-observatory-gmail` tools when they are configured. If setup
  is needed, use its **Connections > Gmail** control in AgentMarkit when that
  control exists. If it is absent, say setup is unavailable for this agent.
  Never substitute a generic Connect page, an old Worker link, a manual
  command, or a broad Gmail or Composio connection.
- **Agent on the user's own computer:** use the local script below. Its token
  stays in `data/gmail_token.json` and can be revoked at
  myaccount.google.com/permissions.

For local use, this is the one piece of network-observatory that holds a
credential, so the deal is spelled out here. Trellis and the map never touch
the network; this script talks to Google directly, using the most limited Gmail
access that exists (`gmail.metadata`). Under that permission Google's own
servers return message headers only — From, To, Cc, Date — and refuse to return
bodies or attachments no matter what the software asks for. The restriction is
enforced by Google, not promised by this code.

## What you can do

```bash
# one person
python3 scripts/email_recency.py "sam@example.com"

# a list, one contact per line
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --batch contacts.txt

# every LinkedIn connection that shared an email with you
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --from-db

# machine-readable, deeper sweep
python3 scripts/email_recency.py --from-db --json --limit 2000
```

First run opens a browser consent screen; approve it once and you're set.
It needs an OAuth client JSON at `data/gmail_oauth_client.json` (ask Mari
for the Filament Email Recency client, or the script prints instructions
for making your own).

## For the agent

- Prefer `--json`. Check the `sweep` block first: nonzero `failed` or
  `undated` means the sweep was incomplete, and an incomplete sweep can only
  understate contact. Say so instead of reporting staleness as fact.
- "Nothing found" means "not in the last N messages swept" (default 500),
  not "never emailed". Raise `--limit` before concluding there's no history.
- A name fragment matches as a substring, so it can hit the wrong person.
  Every result carries `matched_address`; name it in your answer so the user
  can catch a mismatch you can't.
- Results sort stalest first. Lead with the people past 60 days; that's the
  actionable end.
- `--subjects` is the one flag that pulls message content (subject lines).
  Leave it off unless the user explicitly asks what the threads were about.
- Recency labels: active is 14 days or fewer, warm is 15 to 60, cooling is
  61 to 180, cold is over 180.
- Pairs well with Trellis: a `--from-db --json` run is exactly the shape to
  feed `trellis capture` interactions, so radar and loops can reason over
  real email recency. Do that only when the user asks for it.

## On hosted agents (Hermes): don't run this script, ingest instead

After the agent-specific metadata tools are connected, use them instead of
`email_recency.py`. The hosted service keeps connector credentials away from
the agent and exposes only the two metadata tools used below.

The flow on a hosted agent:

1. Call `network_observatory_sweep_email_metadata`, 25 messages at a time.
   Follow `nextPageToken` only as far as the user's question needs. Gmail's
   metadata scope does not allow `q`, so match identities locally.
2. Normalize each message into a Trellis event and hand it over:

```bash
python3 scripts/trellis.py ingest --json '[
  {"person": {"name": "Sam Rivera", "email": "sam@example.com"},
   "kind": "email",
   "date": "2026-07-22",
   "summary": "email received",
   "source": "gmail",
   "source_ref": "<gmail message id>"}
]'
```

Use `<gmail-message-id>:<correspondent-email>` as `source_ref` when a message
contains multiple external participants. That makes ingest idempotent, so re-running over the same messages
is safe: already-seen events are skipped. After ingest, `trellis.py recall`,
`loops`, and `radar` answer recency questions from the same data the local
script would have produced. Store who and when, not what was said.

The hosted tools cannot return subject, snippet, body, or attachments. If a
tool says Gmail needs to be reconnected, tell the user to open this agent in
AgentMarkit and choose **Connections > Gmail**. AgentMarkit must remove the old
grant, finish its Composio cleanup, provision a fresh grant, and ask the
signed-in owner to approve Google again. While the Google OAuth app remains in
Testing, this may be needed again after seven days.

## Design credit

The metadata-only approach follows Maria's email-recency skill
(github.com/123maria0608-star/email-recency-skill). This is an independent
implementation, written for this repo's zero-dependency rule: Python
stdlib only, raw Gmail REST, no Google client libraries.
